* Create a run config in jetbrains for easy debugging. ![Jetbrains.png](Jetbrains.png)
* Set your env if you are on windows ![Jetbrains2.png](Jetbrains2.png)
* if you build the docker you can set them as your interpreter and debug that way. 
  * (I just don't like to leave docker
    running and prefer jetbrains spaces or similar where I can remote in and use docker on "not my machine")
