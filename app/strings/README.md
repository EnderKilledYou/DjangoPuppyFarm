# strings

Pets should be imported using a fixture in [Fixtures](/app/fixtures)
specifically [key-fixtures](/app/fixtures/key-fixtures.json).

## Key Model

A key model is a string and value

## Keys have a viewset which provides default [crud operations [Views]](/app/pets/views.py) but not create and update

Keys have a KeyBoss which take a KeyJob to either create or update a key.
todo: add documentation

## Pets have some tests but they have never been run
